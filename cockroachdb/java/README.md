# Connecting Java and CockroachDB with ADBC

## Not Yet Implemented

A Java example for CockroachDB is not yet available due to an unimplemented feature in the ADBC Java driver manager.

See [apache/arrow-adbc#3868](https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/issues/3868) for details and progress on this issue.
