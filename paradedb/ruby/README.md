# Connecting Ruby and ParadeDB with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a ParadeDB instance running, skip the steps to set up and clean up ParadeDB.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)

2. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

1. Ensure the native Arrow GLib and ADBC GLib libraries required by `red-adbc`
   are installed and discoverable. If `bundle install` reports missing `arrow`,
   `arrow-glib`, or `adbc-glib`, use the platform-specific commands below.

   <details>
   <summary>macOS with Homebrew</summary>

   ```sh
   brew install apache-arrow-glib apache-arrow-adbc-glib
   ```

   </details>

   <details>
   <summary>Debian/Ubuntu</summary>

   ```sh
   sudo apt install libarrow-glib-dev libadbc-glib-dev
   ```

   </details>

   <details>
   <summary>RHEL-compatible distributions</summary>

   ```sh
   sudo dnf install arrow-glib-devel adbc-glib-devel
   ```

   </details>

   <details>
   <summary>Windows with RubyInstaller/MSYS2 UCRT64</summary>

   ```sh
   pacman -S --needed mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-arrow mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-arrow-adbc-glib
   ```

   If you use a different MSYS2 environment, adjust the package prefix to match
   it; for example, use `mingw-w64-x86_64-*` from the MINGW64 shell.

   </details>

1. Install Ruby dependencies:

   ```sh
   bundle install
   ```

   If you have multiple Ruby installations, ensure `ruby` and `bundle` resolve
   to the same installation before running this command.

### Set up ParadeDB

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

2. Start a ParadeDB instance:

    ```sh
    docker run -d --rm --name paradedb -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -p 5432:5432 paradedb/paradedb
    ```

### Connect to ParadeDB

1. Install the PostgreSQL ADBC driver:

    ```sh
    dbc install --level user postgresql
    ```

2. Customize the Ruby script `main.rb` as needed
    - Change the connection arguments in `database.set_option()`
        - Format `uri` according to the [connection URI format used by PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING-URIS), or keep it as is
    - If you changed which database you're connecting to, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `connection.query()`

3. Run the Ruby script:

   ```sh
   bundle exec ruby main.rb
   ```

### Clean up

Stop the Docker container running ParadeDB:

```sh
docker stop paradedb
```
