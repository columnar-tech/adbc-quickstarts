# Connecting Go to PostgreSQL-compatible systems with ADBC

This directory contains examples showing how to use ADBC to connect Go applications to systems that support [PostgreSQL frontend/backend (wire) protocol](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol.html).

## Source systems covered

Any open source tool or vendor product that implements PostgreSQL frontend/backend protocol should work with the ADBC driver for PostgreSQL. The examples included here focus on the following systems:

- [CedarDB](./cedardb)
- [Citus](./citus)
- [CockroachDB](./cockroachdb)
- [CrateDB](./cratedb)
- [Neon](./neon)
- [ParadeDB](./paradedb)
- [PostgreSQL](./postgresql)
- [TimescaleDB](./timescaledb)
- [Yellowbrick](./yellowbrick)
- [YugabyteDB](./yugabytedb)

## Instructions

Each subdirectory contains its own README with specific instructions.
