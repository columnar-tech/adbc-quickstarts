# Connecting Ruby and Dremio with ADBC

## Instructions

This example uses [Dremio](https://www.dremio.com/), a data lakehouse platform that supports Arrow Flight SQL.

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a Dremio instance running, skip the steps to set up Dremio.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)

1. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

1. Ensure the native Arrow GLib and ADBC GLib libraries required by `red-adbc`
   are installed and discoverable. If `bundle install` reports missing `arrow`,
   `arrow-glib`, or `adbc-glib`, use the platform-specific commands below.

   <details>
   <summary>macOS with Homebrew</summary>

   ```sh
   brew install apache-arrow-glib apache-arrow-adbc-glib
   ```

   </details>

   <details>
   <summary>Debian/Ubuntu</summary>

   ```sh
   sudo apt install libarrow-glib-dev libadbc-glib-dev
   ```

   </details>

   <details>
   <summary>RHEL-compatible distributions</summary>

   ```sh
   sudo dnf install arrow-glib-devel adbc-glib-devel
   ```

   </details>

   <details>
   <summary>Windows with RubyInstaller/MSYS2 UCRT64</summary>

   ```sh
   pacman -S --needed mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-arrow mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-arrow-adbc-glib
   ```

   If you use a different MSYS2 environment, adjust the package prefix to match
   it; for example, use `mingw-w64-x86_64-*` from the MINGW64 shell.

   </details>

1. Install Ruby dependencies:

   ```sh
   bundle install
   ```

   If you have multiple Ruby installations, ensure `ruby` and `bundle` resolve
   to the same installation before running this command.

### Set up Dremio

1. [Sign up for Dremio Cloud](https://www.dremio.com/) or follow the instructions to [set up Dremio Community](https://docs.dremio.com/current/get-started/docker/).

### Connect to Dremio

1. Install the Flight SQL ADBC driver:

   ```sh
   dbc install --level user flightsql
   ```

1. Customize the Ruby script `main.rb` as needed
   - Change the connection arguments in `database.set_option()`
     - `uri` is the URI of your Dremio instance. The host and port will depend on your installation (the default port is 32010). The protocol scheme should be `grpc` or `grpc+tcp` if your Dremio instance is not using TLS (e.g. if you are using Dremio Community) and should be `grpc+tls` otherwise (e.g. when using Dremio Cloud).
     - `username` and `password` are the username and password of your Dremio account. (If you are using Dremio Community, these were set during the installation instructions.)
     - For Dremio Cloud, remove `username` and `password`, create a personal access token (PAT), store it in a string variable `token` in the script, and set the connection options to:

       ```ruby
       token = "YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"
       database.set_option("uri", "grpc+tls://data.dremio.cloud:443") # for US region
       # database.set_option("uri", "grpc+tls://data.eu.dremio.cloud:443") # for Europe region
       database.set_option("adbc.flight.sql.authorization_header", "Bearer #{token}")
       ```

   - If you changed `uri` to point to a different Flight SQL server, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `connection.query()`

1. Run the Ruby script:

   ```sh
   bundle exec ruby main.rb
   ```

   The output will look something like this:

   ```
   	    EXPR$0
   	  (double)
   0	  1.436246
   ```
