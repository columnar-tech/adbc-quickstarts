# Connecting Python and PostgreSQL with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a PostgreSQL instance running, skip the steps to install PostgreSQL, start it, load data, and stop it.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

1. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

1. [Install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
   - On macOS, if you have Homebrew installed, run `brew install postgresql@17`

### Set up PostgreSQL

1. Start PostgreSQL
   - If you installed it with Homebrew, run `brew services start postgresql@17`
1. Create a table in PostgreSQL and load data into it by running `psql -d postgres -f games.sql`

### Connect to PostgreSQL

1. Install the PostgreSQL ADBC driver:

   ```sh
   dbc install postgresql
   ```

1. Customize the Python script `main.py` as needed
   - Change the connection arguments in `db_kwargs`
     - Format `uri` according to the [connection URI format used by PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING-URIS), or keep it as is to use the data included with this example
   - If you changed which database you're connecting to, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `cursor.execute()`

1. Run the Python script:

   ```sh
   uv run main.py
   ```

### Clean up

1. Stop PostgreSQL
   - If you installed it with Homebrew, run `brew services stop postgresql@17`
