# Connecting Python and Arrow Flight SQL with ADBC

## Instructions

This example uses [Dremio](https://www.dremio.com/), but other open source tools and vendor products that support Arrow Flight SQL will also work with this driver.

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a Dremio instance running, skip the steps to set up Dremio.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

1. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Set up Dremio

1. [Sign up for Dremio Cloud](https://www.dremio.com/) or follow the instructions to [set up Dremio Community](https://docs.dremio.com/current/get-started/docker/).

### Connect to Dremio

1. Install the Flight SQL ADBC driver:

   ```sh
   dbc install flightsql
   ```

1. Customize the Python script `main.py` as needed
   - Change the connection arguments in `db_kwargs`
     - `uri` is the URI of your Dremio instance. The host and port will depend on your installation (the default port is 32010). The protocol scheme should be `grpc` or `grpc+tcp` if your Dremio instance is not using TLS (e.g. if you are using Dremio Community) and should be `grpc+tls` otherwise (e.g. when using Dremio Cloud).
   - `username` and `password` are the username and password of your Dremio account.
     (If you are using Dremio Community, these were set during the installation instructions.)
   - For Dremio Cloud, remove `username` and `password`, create a personal access token (PAT), store it in a string variable `token` in the script, and set `db_kwargs` to:

     ```python
     db_kwargs={
         "uri": "grpc+tls://data.dremio.cloud:443", # for US region
         #"uri": "grpc+tls://data.eu.dremio.cloud:443", # for Europe region
         "adbc.flight.sql.authorization_header": "Bearer " + token
     }
     ```

1. Run the Python script:

   ```sh
   uv run main.py
   ```

   The output will look something like this:

   ```
   [â€¦]/python3.13/site-packages/adbc_driver_manager/dbapi.py:329: Warning: Cannot   disable autocommit; conn will not be DB-API 2.0 compliant
     warnings.warn(
   pyarrow.Table
   EXPR$0: double
   ----
   EXPR$0: [[1.43624642310197]]
   ```

   Note that the warning is expected (this is because Python's DB-API specifies that connections should not use autocommit, but there is no way to disable this with Dremio).
